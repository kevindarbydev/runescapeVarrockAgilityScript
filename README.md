# runescapeVarrockAgilityScript
Levels agility from 30-40. See README for list of bugs to work on


<strong>2.0 Changes</strong>

 Should loot marks of grace more reliably (method for checking coords of mark -- should prevent trying to loot marks on previous obstacle)
 
Implemented a slow mode that activates every second lap, sleep for 3-30s at various times throughout the course

Start in front of first obstacle for best results
